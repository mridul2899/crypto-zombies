// Chapter 2 - Ownable Contracts
// In the last chapter, anyone can change the address of the contract by calling the external function.
// Therefore, we would rely on Ownable contracts from OpenZeppelin to secure our DApp.
// Ownable contract does the following:
// 1. When a contract is created, it sets the owner to msg.sender (person who deployed it)
// 2. It adds an onlyOwner modifier, which can restrict access to certain functions to only the owner
// 3. It allows transferring ownership of a contract to a new owner.

// Note:
// A constructor is an optional function with the same name as the contract.
// It gets executed only once, when the contract is first created.

// Note:
// Function modifiers are kind of half-functions used to modify other functions.
// These are usually used to check some requirements before executing the function.

        // Chapter 4 - Gas
        // In solidity, users have to pay a currency called gas
        // every time they execute a DApp function.
        // Users buy gas with Ether on Ethereum, and therefore need to spend ETH.
        // The amount of gas required depends on complexity of the function's logic.
        // Each individual operation has a gas cost based on computing resources needed.
        // For example, storage is much more expensive than adding two integers.
        // Hence, code optimization is very important in Ethereum.
        // Gas is necessary to prevent Ethereum network from clogging by intensive
        // computations set by malicious users.

        // Struct packing
        // Normally there is no benefit of using uint8, uint16, uint32 etc.
        // as Solidity reserves 256 bits of storage regardless of the uint size.
        // But there is an exception in case of structs.
        // Using smaller-sized uints inside structs allows Solidity to pack variables together.
        // Thus, they end up taking lesser storage.
        // Moreover, clustering identical data types together can
        // minimize the required storage space.
