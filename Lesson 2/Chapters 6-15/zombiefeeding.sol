    // State variables (variables declared outside of functions) are by default storage.
    // Variables declared inside functions are memory.
    // When dealing with reference types, we need to use these keywords within functions.

    // When we change any attribute or object of a storage variable,
    // it permanently changes the original value on the blockchain because it's a pointer.
    // However, memory variable is just a copy of the original variable,
    // and any change will modify only the temporary variable, not the original.
    // Changing the permanent storage value, in this case, would need explicit value change.
