// Chapter 10 - Interacting with Other Contracts
// We need to define an interface to interact with other contracts deployed on the blockchain.
// Even though defining an interface is looks like defining a contract, there are some differences.
// In an interface, we only declare the functions that we want to interact with.
// We don't mention any of the other functions or state variables.
// Moreover, we don't define function bodies.
// Instead of curly braces ({ and }), we end the function declaration with semicolon (;).
// This allows our contract to know what other contract's functions look like, how to call them,
// and what sort of response to expect.

// In Solidity, a function can return more than one values,
// and all such values can be specified after the return keyword within parentheses, separated by commas.

// To interact with CryptoKitties contract on the blockchain.

    // Chapter 7 - Data Location - Storage & Memory
    // In Solidity, there are two types of locations to store variables - storage and memory.
    // Storage variables are stored permanently on the blockchain.
    // Memory variables are temporary, and are erased between external function calls to the contract.
    // Most times we don't need to use these keywords as Solidity handles these variables automatically.
    // State variables (variables declared outside of functions) are by default storage.
    // Variables declared inside functions are memory.
    // When dealing with reference types, we need to use these keywords within functions.

    // When we change any attribute or object of a storage variable,
    // it permanently changes the original value on the blockchain because it's a pointer.
    // However, memory variable is just a copy of the original variable,
    // and any change will modify only the temporary variable, not the original.
    // Changing the permanent storage value, in this case, would need explicit value change.

        require(zombieToOwner[_zombieId] == msg.sender);
        Zombie storage myZombie = zombies[_zombieId];

        _targetDna = _targetDna % dnaModulus;
        uint256 newDna = (myZombie.dna + _targetDna) / 2;

        // Chapter 9 - More on Function Visibility
        // In Chapter 8, we called a private function from within ZombieFeeding.
        // However, it's a private function inside ZombieFactory.
        // This means none of the inherited contracts can access it, and therefore it was a mistake.

        // Soliidity has two more visibility keywords: internal and external.
        // internal is same as private, except that it's accessible from inherited contracts.
        // external is similar to public, except that functions can only be called outside the contract.
        // external functions cannot be called by other functions inside that contract.
