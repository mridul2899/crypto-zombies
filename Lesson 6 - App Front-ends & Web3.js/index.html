      Chapter 1 - Intro to Web3.js
      To call a function on a smart contract, one needs to query an Ethereum node,
      and tell address of contract, function to call, parameters for function.
      Ethereum nodes communicate only in JSON-RPC format, which isn't human friendly.
      Web3.js abstracts queries and makes it easy to interact with contracts in a JS interface.

      To install web3.js -> npm install web3
      Or one may also download the minified .js file and include it in the project.
      In this chapter, we choose to do the latter for the sake of simplicity.
